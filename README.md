# Defining-the-types-of-quests-in-games
This code analyzes the types of quests (what the player needs to do) based on the content of the quest texts (tasks), using a detailed description of the quests.


* The true metrics were created independently during code execution and may be inaccurate.
* The number of "other" type quests means that more types of quests can be added.
