# Defining-the-types-of-quests-in-games
This code analyzes the types of quests (what the player needs to do) based on the content of the quest texts (tasks), using a detailed description of the quests from the dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/dprashar/npc_dialogue_rpg_quests).


* The true metrics were created independently during code execution (def detect_quest_type) and may be changed.
* The number of "other" type quests means that more types of quests can be added.

The language used in the code to create graphs, output data, and comments is Russian.
